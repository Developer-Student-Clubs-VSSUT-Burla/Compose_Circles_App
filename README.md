# CIRCLES - If there is a Will, there is a Circle!
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Over 80% of Fortune 100 companies conduct hackathons to drive innovation. More than 50% of the hackathons are recurring events, indicating that they are a reliable tool for sustained innovation. According to the present competitive landscape, over a thousand hackathons ,competitive programming, and open source competitions are held internationally each year. 
However, it is quite difficult for students to be constantly aware of such events and to be properly prepared. Students who are not part of an appropriate community that can inform them about different contests, they miss out on chances to realise their inner potential. When students in a field are looking for appropriate teammates but are unable to get any help due to poor communication and lack of other students' enthusiasm, their ability to participate in a competition is limited by their contact radius.


**PROPOSED SOLUTION**
 
The app's architecture consists of a home screen that requests the user's skill set and offers three options‚Äîhackathons, coding competitions, and open source‚Äîso that the user can select the platform on which he wishes to compete.

 Additionally, it prompts users to select a skill set from the list of options. The app's ability to help the user identify suitable teammates is its most intriguing feature. Users don't need to freak out when looking for teammates about a person's domain. A list will be filtered out by the programme, which will then present it to the user for selection. 

This app also gives users the opportunity to text with the students they want on their team and can get a chance to have proper conversation.

## FUNCTIONALITY & CONCEPTS USED

FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION: The login and signup functionality of the app is implemented using the firebase authentication. Each valid user is allowed to create an account with the help of the email and password and can log back in with the same credentials.

NAVIGATION LIBRARY:  In the app in order to switch between different screens and components a navigation library is used.

LOTTIE ANIMATION LIBRARY: We implemented Lottie library in order to incorporate animations in our app. This overall improved the user-experience of our app and gave a new look to the user interface.


## APPLICATION AND FUTURE SCOPE
The app is yet to be developed in order to be used in a wider spectrum.
<br>
We want to improve our app even further by introducing sophisticated features like a Mentor-Mentee area to help students prepare for contests, making it more versatile.<br>
We also plan to integrate the expected dates for hackathons and contests with Google Calendar to updated¬†with dates.
Furthermore, we would include a feature for the resources stores, whether hardware or software, that would be necessary for the hackathons.<br>
This application will undoubtedly assist students who wish to engage in hackathons and be prepared to innovate.<br>
